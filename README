Setting up the Database
Database Configuration:

Database: MySQL
Username: root
Password: root
Running the SQL Script:

Client : Client
Pot : Cagnotte
Trader : Commer√ßant

Open your MySQL database management tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench).
Execute the SQL script provided in resources directory to create the database schema and populate it with initial data.

DTO logic is not completely implemented since my entities don't have much attributes and that im not supposed to print them somewhere.

We could create an abstract class Person since we have Client and Trader for our API.
